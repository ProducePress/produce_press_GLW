  "state_of_market": "Fresh-run onions are plentiful across the Northwest with markets steady at lower levels, while new-crop Norkotah potatoes are being harvested through mid-October. Berries are mixed: blueberries remain elevated as the PNW season tapers and Peru ramps, strawberries are inching up as Salinas/Watsonville wind down and Santa Maria starts. Lettuce/leaf items are mostly steady-to-weak with ample supplies in Salinas/Santa Maria; heat and pest pressure continue to be monitored in several crops. Melons are steady with excellent sugars as San Joaquin winds down and desert transitions approach. Avocado prices are low on strong Mexican volume; lemons remain tight and elevated; limes are easing. Overall quality trends good-to-excellent across many items with a few weather/seasonal caveats.",

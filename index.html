            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg">
                This week's produce market is characterized by several regional transitions and lingering weather impacts, influencing supply and pricing across various commodities.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Weather Impacts:</strong> Tropical Depression Chantal, which made landfall on July 6, caused minimal damage but brought 2-4 inches of rain to Central and Eastern North Carolina, leading to expected harvesting and fruit maturity delays. This has contributed to limited green bell pepper supplies on the East Coast and lower volumes for some produce from Mexico due to heavy rains and hail. Hurricane Flossie is also mentioned as a potential rain bringer to Baja later this week, though a direct hit is not expected. Cooler temperatures in Santa Maria, California, may slow squash growth.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Transitioning Regions:</strong> The industry is actively transitioning between growing regions. Mexican grape supplies are winding down as California-grown fruit is expected to begin next week. Cantaloupe and honeydew production is shifting from California's Imperial Valley to the San Joaquin Valley. Onions are moving from Washington's storage season to fresh runs in Northern California and and New Mexico. Michigan's asparagus season is wrapping up, with Central Mexico set to dominate summer supply. California Bartletts will begin shipping around July 14, as Washington's D'Anjou pear storage crop nears its end.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Market Conditions:</strong> Overall, prices are elevated for several items due to tight supplies and strong demand, including lemons, broccoli, bell peppers, chile peppers, cucumbers, cauliflower, grapes, green leaf lettuce, limes, iceberg lettuce, and pineapples. Conversely, asparagus and red/yellow potato prices are lower or steady due to strong supplies. Quality remains generally good across most commodities, though some issues like pressure bruising in potatoes, purple cast in broccoli, and scarring in tomatoes have been noted. Strawberry and raspberry markets are steady with good quality, despite strawberries being past their peak in some California regions.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Green Leaf, Iceberg, and Romaine Lettuce:</strong>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>Green leaf and romaine prices are fairly steady at moderately elevated levels, while iceberg continues rising at elevated market levels, due to continued strong demand in Salinas and Santa Maria, California.</li>
                    <li>MFC Premium Green Leaf, Iceberg, and Romaine are available; Markon Best Available (MBA) is being substituted when needed due to light weights.</li>
                    <li>Overall quality is good; fluctuating densities, insect pressure, and internal burn are present in some lots.</li>
                    <li>MFC Iceberg weights are in the mid-to upper 40 lbs., West Coast packer label ranges from mid-30 to mid-40 lbs.</li>
                    <li>Guanajuato, Mexico, supplies continue to be less than normal following a hailstorm and ongoing rains, prompting processors and fresh market buyers to shift demand from Mexico to California.</li>
                    <li>Elevated markets are expected to continue through mid-July, at minimum.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Picking the Perfect Watermelon: Your Guide to Sweet Summer Slices</strong>
                <br><br>
                Watermelon is a quintessential summer fruit, known for its refreshing sweetness and hydrating properties. But how do you pick a truly ripe and juicy one from the bunch? While it might seem like a guessing game, there are several key indicators that can help you select the perfect watermelon every time.
                <br><br>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Field Spot (or Ground Spot)</strong><br>
                        This is perhaps the most reliable sign of ripeness. Look for a large, creamy yellow or even orange-yellow patch on the underside of the watermelon. This spot is where the melon rested on the ground and ripened in the sun [1]. A white or pale green spot indicates that the watermelon was picked too early and isn't as ripe [2].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dull, Not Shiny, Skin</strong><br>
                        A ripe watermelon will have a dull, matte appearance. If the skin is shiny, it's likely underripe. As the watermelon matures, its natural waxy coating develops, giving it a less reflective finish [3].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Heavy for its Size</strong><br>
                        Pick up a few watermelons of similar size. The one that feels heaviest for its size is usually the juiciest and most ripe [1]. Watermelons are over 90% water, so a heavier melon indicates higher water content and thus more juiciness [4].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The "Thump" Test"</strong><br>
                        While some experts debate its reliability, many people swear by the thump test. Gently tap the watermelon with your knuckles. A ripe watermelon should produce a deep, hollow sound, almost like a drum [2]. An unripe melon will sound higher-pitched or metallic, while an overripe one might sound dull or flat [1]. This takes practice to discern, so combine it with other indicators.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Webbing and Sugar Spots</strong><br>
                        Look for brown, coarse, web-like lines or small black dots on the rind. These are sometimes called "sugar spots" or "pollination scars" and indicate that the watermelon is full of sugar and sweetness [3].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Check the Tendril (if present)</strong><br>
                        If you're picking from a vine, the tendril (the curly "pigtail" nearest where the melon was attached to the vine) is a good indicator. If it's brown and dried up, the watermelon is likely ripe. If it's still green, it's probably not ready [2].
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                By using a combination of these tips, you'll significantly increase your chances of bringing home a perfectly sweet and juicy watermelon.
